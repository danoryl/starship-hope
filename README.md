# Starship Hope
## A demo of text adventure made in Python and Flask

**Step into a weird space world with the Starship Hope and its crew**

In the middle of the 21st century, Earth is fighting its first space battle against an invading fleet known as the "Venster," ugly and malevolent aliens that vaguely resemble large potatoes with monstrous mouths. Caught off guard, humanity is decimated even before it can organize a response. Fortunately, shortly after the arrival of the Venster, another alien civilization contacts our planet: the Atarians, shape-shifting beings composed of pure energy who could wipe out the entire Venster fleet with a single thought, but they don't, otherwise it would be a very boring story. Instead, they aid the fledgling Earth Resistance by building the Starship Hope for us, capable of guiding the Earth fleet and defeating the Venster. The Hope is the first spacecraft equipped with an HyperSphere, a technology similar to the Warp drive, but rounder and cooler. You, my dear player, have enlisted in the Resistance a few months before the start of this adventure, determined to contribute to saving our planet. During the first real battle you are aboard a support ship when it's disabled by the Venster. Having managed to escape, you now float in the void with your spacesuit, when you see not far from you the unmistakable silhouette of the Hope, with its HyperSphere. Something is wrong, because even the Hope seems completely inert, lifeless. Your suit's portable analyzer shows no signs of human life on board. What could have happened?
